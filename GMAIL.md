# GMAIL

In this app I am using Gmail SMTP server.

Of course you can use any other SMTP.

Feel free to use this app for your needs.

### Pre-Requisites

- You need a <b>GMAIL</b> account.

- You need the credentials for that account, so <i>email</i> and <i>password</i>

### Gmail Account Setup

By default, Gmail will not allow your app to login and make requests.

For this to work you need to go to <i>Manage your Google Account </i> => <i>Security </i> => <i>Less Secure Apps</i>

There you just need to turn on the access of less secure apps and you are good to go.
